A rudimentary Card Game Simulator
# WAR
This was the Coding assignment for Week 06 of Promineo Tech's Backend Cohort.
The assignment was to make a simplified/automated version of the cardgame "War."
The project required 4 classes to be created: A Card class, A Deck class, A Player class, and an Application class that utilizes the other 3 classes.
I made a slight deviation on the project and added a tiebreaker in the event of a tie, similar to how the real game is played.
